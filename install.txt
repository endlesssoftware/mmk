Building and Installing MMK
---------------------------

The MMK.ZIP package includes all the source code needed to build MMK from
sources on recent versions of OpenVMS.

Requirements:
  * a recent-vintage DEC C/HP C compiler
  * MACRO (on VAX) or the MACRO-32 compiler (Alpha and IA64)
  * SDL

Optional:
  * RUNOFF (for building the help file)
  * DEC Document (for building the manual)

If you do not already have a make utility of some kind, you can use the
bootstrap command procedure included in the source directory:

    $ @COMPILE

This should build the MMK executable from scratch.

You should be able to use the included DESCRIP.MMS file to build MMK
if you either have a copy of MMK already, or you have the DEC/MMS
utility.

The MMK.EXE image should be invoked through a DCL "foreign command" symbol.
Copy the image to an appropriate directory, and define a symbol for it:

    $ MMK :== $device:[dir]MMK


A RUNOFF (.RNH) file is included for generating help that is suitable for
inclusion in the system help library.  You can install it in the library
with:

    $ LIBRARY/REPLACE/HELP SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB MMK_HELP.HLP

The DESCRIP.MMS file included in the source kit includes the commands for
generating the .HLP file from the .RNH file.


BUILDING MMK FROM SOURCES
-------------------------

If you wish to build MMK from the source code provided in the source directory
included in the ZIP archive, just use MMK or DEC/MMS to build it, or invoke
the COMPILE.COM command procedure while your default is set to the source
directory.  Note that this command procedure may need some editing, depending
on your system's architecture and version of VMS.

All of the files needed for building the executable are provided in the source
kit.
