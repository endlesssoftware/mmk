<chapter>(Introduction\MMK_DOC_7)
<p>This chapter describes MMK.  It includes an
overview of MMK and basic information on its use.
<head1>(Overview\MMK_DOC_8)
<p>MMK is a tool for building a <quote>(software system;) that is, a collection
of one or more executable images or other types of files that are related to a
particular project.  Building a complex system by hand can be a difficult
and time-consuming task; using command procedures can make the task easier,
but it may still be time-consuming.
<p>With MMK, you create a file called a <emphasis>(Makefile) or
<emphasis>(MMS description file) to describe your software system: the
<newterm>(objects) (i.e., source files, object files, etc.) that comprise the
system, the <newterm>(dependencies) between those objects, and the commands
used to build the system.  When you
invoke MMK, it performs the following steps:
<list>(numbered)
<le>MMK reads and parses the description file, constructing a tree from
the objects and dependencies listed in the file.
<le>It then identifies the object to be built (called the <emphasis>(target)).
<le>The tree of dependencies is traced from the target, and the revision dates
for the files in that path are compared.  If an object doesn't exist or is
older than the object it depends on, the commands to
build the object are executed in a subprocess.  This continues until all
objects along the dependency path have been checked and the target
has been brought completely up-to-date.
<endlist>
<p>In this way, MMK can execute the commands to rebuild only those pieces of your
software system that need rebuilding due to a change that you have made.
This can drastically reduce development time for a project.
<head1>(Invoking MMK\MMK_DOC_9)
<p>Provided that MMK has been installed using the steps laid out in
the installation instructions (file AAAREADME.INSTALL in the kit), you can
invoke MMK from DCL as a foreign command:
<interactive>
<S>($)<u>(MMK)
<endinteractive>
<p>Full command syntax is given in <reference>(mmk_syntax).  By default,
MMK looks for a description file called DESCRIP.MMS in the current directory;
if that file does not exist, it then looks for a file called MAKEFILE.  If
it cannot find that file, an error is signaled.  You can use the /DESCRIPTION
qualifier to specify a different name for your description file, if needed.
<p>MMK starts by reading the description file and constructing a tree
from the <newterm>(objects) listed in the description file
(e.g., source files, include files,
object files, etc.) and a tree of <newterm>(dependencies) between those
objects.  It then identifies the <newterm>(target) object to be built,
and traverses the dependency tree to identify those objects that need to
be built (called <emphasis>(intermediate targets)) in order to build the target.
<p>MMK compares each target's revision date/time against the objects on which
it depends and executes the actions for that building the target only if needed.
You can force a complete
rebuild by using the /FROM_SOURCES qualifier on the MMK command.
<chapter>(Description Files\MMK_DOC_10)
<p>The key to successfully building your software system with MMK is
the creation of
a complete and accurate description file.  This chapter describes the format
for a description file and its components.
<head1>(Description File Components\MMK_DOC_11)
<p>A description file is a collection of the following components:
<list>(unnumbered)
<le><emphasis>(Dependencies\bold), which describe how one object depends
on one or more other objects.
<le><emphasis>(Actions\bold), which are commands to be executed when an object
needs to be built.
<le><emphasis>(Macro definitions\bold), for defining symbols that may be
used in rules or actions.
<le><emphasis>(Inference rule definitions\bold), which are rules based on
suffixes (and possibly directories as well), from which MMK can infer
dependencies and actions without you having to list them explicitly in
your makefile.
<le><emphasis>(MMK directives\bold), which provide a means for adding
commands to be executed before or after all other actions, provide a simple
conditional-build mechanism, and other directives for modifying MMK's behavior.
<endlist>
<p>Here is an example of a simple description file:
<interactive>
PROGRAM.EXE : MAIN.OBJ,SUBROUTINES.OBJ
    LINK/EXEC=PROGRAM.EXE MAIN.OBJ,SUBROUTINES.OBJ
MAIN.OBJ : MAIN.FOR
    FORTRAN MAIN
SUBROUTINES.OBJ : SUBROUTINES.MAR
    MACRO SUBROUTINES
<endinteractive>
<p>This is a simple collection of dependencies and actions for building
an image called PROGRAM.EXE.  PROGRAM.EXE depends on two object files,
called MAIN.OBJ and SUBROUTINES.OBJ; MAIN is a FORTRAN module and
SUBROUTINES is a MACRO module.
<p>MMK accepts either a colon or the DEC/MMS DEPENDS_ON keyword to separate
a target object from its sources.  In either case, the separator must be
surrounded by blanks -- this differs from <emphasis>(make), but is consistent
with DEC/MMS syntax.
<head1>(Using Inference Rules\MMK_DOC_12)
<p>MMK includes a collection of built-in inference rules and actions
for most VMS programming languages.  The rules are driven by the file type
suffix attached to the object name; you must use the default file types
in order to make use of the default rules.
<p>For example, the description file in the last section could be simplified
to just:
<interactive>
PROGRAM.EXE : MAIN.OBJ,SUBROUTINES.OBJ
    LINK/EXEC=PROGRAM.EXE MAIN.OBJ,SUBROUTINES.OBJ
MAIN.OBJ : MAIN.FOR
SUBROUTINES.OBJ : SUBROUTINES.MAR
<endinteractive>
<p>MMK's built-in inference rules automatically define the actions for
building a .OBJ file from a .FOR (using the FORTRAN command) and for building
a .OBJ file from a .MAR file (using the MACRO command).
<P>The description file could even be simplified further, to just:
<interactive>
PROGRAM.EXE : MAIN.OBJ,SUBROUTINES.OBJ
    LINK/EXEC=PROGRAM.EXE MAIN.OBJ,SUBROUTINES.OBJ
<endinteractive>
<p>MMK automatically searches the <emphasis>(suffixes list) when
constructing the dependency tree and locates inference rules for
the .OBJ files automatically.  This illustrates the second use
for inference rules: they are used not only for inferring actions
for a dependency that omits them, but they may also be used for
inferring dependencies themselves based on a combination of
source and target suffixes.  This second purpose can greatly simplify
your makefiles, and makes the build process more automatic.

<head1>(Defining Inference Rules\infrules)
<P>
You can define your own inference rules, either to extend or replace the
ones built into MMK.  You may include these rule definitions in your
makefile, or in a separate file called a <emphasis>(rules file).  Rules
files can be included by the use of a logical name or through the /RULES
qualifier on the MMK command; see the <reference>(mmk_syntax) for further
information.
<P>
MMK supports two types of inference rules: <emphasis>(generic) and
<emphasis>(prefixed).  Generic rules are based solely on suffixes (file types),
as in:
<interactive>
.C.OBJ :
    CC/OBJECT=$(MMS$TARGET) $(MMS$SOURCE)
<endinteractive>
<cp>
which says, <quote>(to build <emphasis>(filename).OBJ from an existing file
called <emphasis>(filename).C, use the <emphasis>(CC\bold) command.)  In
general, generic rules work best when the source and target files reside
in the same directory.
<P>
<emphasis>(Prefixed) inference rules are based on both suffixes and
<quote>(prefixes) -- device and directory specifications.  This provides
a way to have MMK automatically infer dependenices between files that
reside in different directories.  For example:
For example, the prefixed rule:
<interactive>
{SRC$:}.C{OBJ$:}.OBJ :
    CC/OBJECT=$(MMS$TARGET) $(MMS$SOURCE)
<endinteractive>
<P>
tells MMK, <quote>(to build OBJ$:<emphasis>(filename).OBJ from an existing
file called SRC$:<emphasis>(filename).C, use the <emphasis>(CC\bold) command.)
This works like the generic rule above, but with the additional provision
of having the source and target reside in different locations.
<p>
You can have more than one prefixed rule for a particular pair of suffixes;
you may also mix generic rules and prefixed rules for a pair of suffixes.
When attempting to infer a dependency, MMK will first use the prefixed
rules, then fall back to using the generic rule.
<P>
In prefixed rules, the curly braces (<quote>({) and <quote>(})) are required.
One of the two prefixes may be null, but specifying two null prefixes is
equivalent to defining a generic rule.
<P>
In order to match a prefixed rule, file specification <emphasis>(as
it exists in the description file) must match the prefix in the rule; MMK
performs no logical name translation on prefixes, nor can it identify
equivalencies between two prefixes that reference the same directory using
different syntax.
<P>
The first inference rule for a pair of suffixes, whether it is generic
or prefixed, must specify an action list; subsequent rules for the same
pair of suffixes (with different prefixes) may have the action list omitted,
in which case MMK will use the action list from the first rule.  For example,
MMK already has a built-in generic rule for .C.OBJ, which is:
<interactive>
.C.OBJ :
    $(CC)$(CFLAGS) $(MMS$SOURCE)
<endinteractive>
<p>
If you are simply adding a set of prefixed rules for the .C.OBJ suffix pair,
you do not need to specify an action list on those rules; MMK will use the
action list from the built-in generic rule.

<head1>(Forced Setup/Teardown Actions in Inference Rules\forcedST)
<P>
MMK recognizes two special modifiers on action lines specified for inference
rules.  The <emphasis>(setup) modifier, <quote>(<), forces the execution
of an action prior to any unmodified action.  The <emphasis>(teardown)
modifier, <quote>(>), forces the execution of an action after all other
actions.  Setup and teardown actions are performed for all dependencies
matching the inference rule, even if a dependency includes explicit
actions.
<p>For example, the inference rule
<interactive>
.C.OBJ :
    < DEFINE/USER DECC$SHR V6_ROOT:[SYSLIB]DECC$SHR
      $(CC)$(CFLAGS) $(MMS$SOURCE)
<endinteractive>
<P>
would cause the logical name DECC$SHR to be defined prior to the invocation
of the C compiler for all compilations into .OBJ files.  This would apply
even on dependencies containing explicit actions, such as
<interactive>
FRED.OBJ : FRED.C
  $(CC)$(CFLAGS)/DEFINE=FRED $(MMS$SOURCE)
<endinteractive>

<head1>(Modifying the Suffix List\MMK_DOC_13)
<P>
MMK uses a <emphasis>(suffix list) to determine the inference rules it
should search for inferring a dependency.  MMK has a built-in suffix
list which goes with its list of built-in inference rules; see
<reference>(default_rules) for more information on the built-in rules
and suffix list.
<P>You can augment or replace the built-in suffix list
with your own suffixes by using the .SUFFIXES directive in a rules
file or a makefile.
<P>For example, let's say you have a Modula-2 compiler on your system, whose
source files have a file type (suffix) of .MOD. MMK has no built-in inference
rules for this file type; you could add one with the following sequence:
<interactive>
.SUFFIXES : .MOD

.MOD.OBJ :
    MODULA2/OBJECT=$(MMS$TARGET) $(MMS$SOURCE)
<endinteractive>
<P>
The .SUFFIXES directive above adds the .MOD suffix to the end of the
suffix list.  This is followed by the inference rule for creating an
object file from a Modula-2 source file.

<P>
Specifying the .SUFFIXES directive with nothing to the right of the colon
clears the current suffix list.  You can do this to prevent MMK from
using any inference rules for the current build, or to follow it with
another .SUFFIXES directive that specifies only those suffixes for which you
want inference rules to be enabled.

<head1>(Using Conditionals\using_cond)
<p>
MMK provides several directives that can be used to modify the build sequence
based on conditions.  These directives are .IF, .IFDEF, .IFNDEF, .ELSE,
.ELSIF and .ENDIF.  The .IFDEF directive checks if the specified macro is
defined and .IFNDEF is the logical inverse, the syntax of which is:

<interactive>
.IFDEF VEGETABLE
...
.ENDIF
<endinteractive>

<p>or,

<interactive>
.IFNDEF VEGETABLE
...
.ENDIF
<endinteractive>

<p>The .IF directive supports more general comparison (and thus greater
power) by allowing the specification of a boolean expression, like so:

<interactive>
.IF expression
...
[.ELSEIF expression]
[...]
[.ELSE]
[...]
.ENDIF
<endinteractive>

<p>In the example above, <emphasis>(expression) can be replaced by any
operations consisting of the operators (both MMS and MMK operators are
listed) listed in <reference>(boolop).

<table>(Conditional Expression Operators\boolop)
<table_setup>(3\10\10)
<table_heads>(MMS Syntax\MMK Syntax\Example)
<table_unit>
<table_unit_heads>(<span>(3)Boolean Operators)
<table_row>(.AND\AND\expression .AND expression)
<table_row>(.NOT\NOT\.NOT expression)
<table_row>(.OR\OR\expression .OR expression)
<endtable_unit>
<table_unit>
<table_unit_heads>(<span>(3)Comparison Operators)
<table_row>(.EQ\EQL\expression .EQ expression)
<table_row>(.GE\GEQ\expression .GE expression)
<table_row>(.GT\GTR\expression .GT expression)
<table_row>(.LE\LEQ\expression .LE expression)
<table_row>(.LT\LSS\expression .LT expression)
<table_row>(.NE\NEQ\expression .NE expression)
<endtable_unit>
<endtable>

<p>All expressions evaluate to a boolean result.  After all macro substitution
is performed and the the operand is not an empty string it is the equivalent
of a boolean TRUE.  All comparisons are performed without regard to
upper/lower case.

<head2>(GNU Make Conditionals\gnucond)
<p>
Supplemental to the MMS/MMK conditionals, MMK also supports the specification
of the GNU Make-style conditionals <emphasis>(ifeq), <emphasis>(ifneq),
<emphasis>(ifdef), <emphasis>(ifndef), <emphasis>(else) and <emphasis>(endif).
The ifdef and ifndef conditionals behave exactly as their MMS/MMK
counter-parts.  However, ifeq and ifneq have a slightly different syntax:

<interactive>
ifeq (arg1, arg2)
ifeq 'arg1' 'arg2'
ifeq "arg1" "arg2"
ifeq "arg1" 'arg2'
ifeq 'arg1' "arg2"
<endinteractive>

<p>Although the example lists ifeq, it can be replaced with its logical
inverse, ifneq.  These two directives simply compare their arguments
(ignoring case) and test for equality.  The following is an example adapted
from the GNU Make manual:

<interactive>
ifeq ($(strip $(foo)),)
# Come in here if foo is an empty string
...
endif
<endinteractive>

<p>In order to use the conditionals it is necessary to first enable them.
This can be done from the command line with the specification of the
/EXTENDED_SYNTAX=GNU_SYNTAX qualifier or with the .GNU_SYNTAX directive in
the description file.

<head1>(Macro Definitions\macrodef)
<p>
MMK supports a range of operators for assigning values to macros.  To simplyfy
description files it is possible to concatenate and test before assignment.
<reference>(macops) defines the available assignment operators.

<table>(Macro Assignment Operator\macops)
<table_setup>(3\8\20)
<table_heads>(Operator\Description\Example)
<table_row>(<emphasis>(=\bold)\Assign value.\<interactive>(FOO = BAR))
<table_row>(<emphasis>(+=\bold)\Concatenate to existing value.\<interactive>(FOR += ,NEXT))
<table_row>(<emphasis>(?=\bold)\Assign if macro is undefined.\<interactive>(FOO ?= FIRST))
<table_row>(<emphasis>(!=\bold)\Assign command results.\<interactive>(FOO != DIRECTORY))
<table_row>(<emphasis>(~=\bold)\Completely evaluate value before assignment\)
<endtable>

<P>
Two of these assignment operators behave a little differently than the others.
They are both described in more detail below.

<head2>(Command Assignment)
<p>Command assignment is the <emphasis>(!=\bold) operator.  The assigned
value is taken as a command and executed, with the results being assigned
to the macro.  Using this mechanism it would be possible to determine
some details of the running system, like so:

<interactive>
FOO != SHOW SYSTEM/NOPROCESS
ALL :
    @ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT "$(FOO)"
<endinteractive>

<p>the results of which might look something like:

<interactive>
$ MMK
OpenVMS V7.3  on node BENDER  15-FEB-2013 16:05:10.03  Uptime  37 15:54:40
<endinteractive>

<note>
<p>
The '!' character is already a comment delimiter in MMK.  To resolve this,
the MMK description file parser now tests for a '=' character immediately
following a '!'.  Usually when detecting a '!' character the remainder of the
line (including the comment delimiter) will be stripped from the output.
However, in this special case the delimiter and the following characters will 
not be stripped and instead parsed as an assignment.  This may create issues
for existing procedures that contain comments that match this pattern.
<P>
However, it is worth noting that this restriction only applies to the
'!' comment delimiter.  It is still possible to use '#' in any place
and achieve the desired result.
<endnote>

<head2>(Evaluated Assignment)
<p>
Evaluated assignment is the <emphasis>(~=\bold) operator.  This assignment
operator is special in that it completely evaluated the value before
assigning it to the macro.

<p>
All records in the description file are evaluated and an attempt is made to
resolve all macros as they are read in to the parser.  However, if an
unresolved macro, or a builtin function call is found it is not
evaluated to the empty string, rather it is retained for a time when those
macros are available.  An example from the default definitions within MMK
is:

<code_example>
BASIC       = BASIC
BASFLAGS    = /NOLIST/OBJECT=$(MMS$TARGET_NAME)$(OBJ)
<endcode_example>

The definition of BASFLAGS will not be evaluated fully as the description
file is processed, leaving MMS$TARGET_NAME and OBJ unresolved until BASFLAGS
is resolved as a part of executing the build actions that include this
definition (shown below).

<code_example>
.BAS$(OBJ) :
    $(BASIC)$(BASFLAGS) $(MMS$SOURCE)
<endcode_example>

<P>
Sometimes this is not what is wanted and it is necessary to evaluate the
definition completely.  The following is an excert from the procedure
that builds MMK's PCSI Product Definition File.

<code_example>
DOCUMENTATION ~= $(ADDPREFIX $(KITDIR),$(WILDCARD $(KITDIR)*.HTML)) -
                 $(ADDPREFIX $(KITDIR),$(WILDCARD $(KITDIR)*.PDF)) -
                 $(ADDPREFIX $(KITDIR),$(WILDCARD $(KITDIR)*.PS)) -
                 $(ADDPREFIX $(KITDIR),$(WILDCARD $(KITDIR)*.TXT))
<endcode_example>

Without being able to evaluate the macro definition for DOCUMENTATION
the list documentation files would actually evaluate to the function
calls, not the results of the builtin function calls.

<head1>(Deferring Macro Substitution\deferring)
<p>
MMK provides a way to defer the resolution of a macro that is referenced
in the right-hand side of a macro definition, as an extension to MMS.
Macros are normally referenced using the $(<emphasis>(name)) syntax,
which causes the value of the macro to be substituted immediately when
a line is parsed (except for MMK's <quote>(special) macros, such as
MMS$SOURCE and MMS$TARGET).
<P>
You can defer this substitution in MMK by using the syntax ${<emphasis>(name)}
instead.  However, this syntax is only recognized on the right-hand side
of a macro definition.  This can be useful when defining macros in a rules
file that rely on macros that do not get defined until another rules file
or a description file gets processed.  For example, you might have the
following definition in a rules file:
<interactive>
CFLAGS = /OBJECT=$(MMS$TARGET)/NOLIST/DEFINE=(VMS_BUILD,${MOREDEFINES})
<endinteractive>
<cp>then in your description file, you can define the MOREDEFINES macro:
<interactive>
MOREDEFINES = ANOTHER_C_DEFINE
<endinteractive>
<cp>This will complete the CFLAGS macro value when it is referenced later
in the description file.

<head1>(Macro String Substitution\macrosubst)
<p>
MMK provides two mechanisms for causing string substitution to occur when
resolving a macro reference: suffix substitution and general string substitution.
<HEAD2>(Suffix Substitution\suffixsubst)
<P>
When a string contains a list of file specifications, you can replace the file
type suffixes on each file specification with a different suffix.  The general
form of this type of substitution is:
<SYNTAX>
<EMPHASIS>($<OPAREN>\BOLD)<EMPHASIS>(macro-name)<EMPHASIS>(:\BOLD)<EMPHASIS>(old-sfx)<EMPHASIS>(=\BOLD)<EMPHASIS>(new-sfx)<EMPHASIS>(<CPAREN>\BOLD)
<ENDSYNTAX>
<CP>which causes the replacement of all occurences of the file type suffix <EMPHASIS>(old-sfx) with <EMPHASIS>(new-sfx).
Both suffixes must begin with a dot.
<P>For example,
in these macro definitions:
<INTERACTIVE>
SOURCES = FIRST.C, SECOND.C, THIRD.C
OBJECTS = $(SOURCES:.C=.OBJ)
<ENDINTERACTIVE>
<CP>the OBJECTS macro would have the value <QUOTE>(FIRST.OBJ, SECOND.OBJ, THIRD.OBJ).
This form of substitution works with file specification lists separated by either
blanks, commas, or both.  The substitution rule following the colon may also contain
blanks, which are ignored.  Substitutions are case-insensitive.

<HEAD2>(General String Substitution\stringsubst)
<P>
General string substitution in macro references is an extended feature of MMK.  It
looks very similar to suffix substitution, but uses a double colon (<quote>(::))
instead of a single colon and allows the substitution to occur anywhere within
the string.  The syntax is:
<SYNTAX>
<EMPHASIS>($<OPAREN>\BOLD)<EMPHASIS>(macro-name)<EMPHASIS>(::\BOLD)<EMPHASIS>(old-str)<EMPHASIS>(=\BOLD)<EMPHASIS>(new-str)<EMPHASIS>(<CPAREN>\BOLD)
<ENDSYNTAX>
<CP>which causes the replacement of all occurences of the string <EMPHASIS>(old-str) with <EMPHASIS>(new-str).
You may use a backslash <QUOTE>(<BACKSLASH>) as a <quote>(literal-next) escape when one of the strings contains
an equals sign. Neither string may contain a right parenthesis character (<QUOTE>(<CPAREN>)), even quoted with a backslash,
although this restriction will be lifted in a future release of MMK.

For example, the following macro definitions:
<INTERACTIVE>
SOURCES = FIRST.C,SECOND.C,THIRD.C
SOURCEPLUS = $(SOURCES::,=+)
<ENDINTERACTIVE>
<CP>would cause SOURCEPLUS to contain the list of filenames separated with plus
signs (<QUOTE>(+)) rather than commas.
<P>General string substitutions in macro references are case-insensitive, but
<emphasis>(do not) ignore blanks in the macro value or in the substitution rule.
For example, in the following definitions:
<INTERACTIVE>
TEST      = Xyz xYz xyZ
REPLACED  = $(TEST::YZ =YZ,)
<ENDINTERACTIVE>
<CP>the REPLACED macro would have the value <QUOTE>(XYZ,xYZ,xyZ), due to the
case-blind comparisons and the inclusion of the space in the <EMPHASIS>(old-str)
specification.

<head1>(Builtin Functions\builtins)
<p>
As well as symbol substituion it is also possible to call a number of
builtin functions that can process text to automate and simplify build
definitions.  The following reference describes what each of these functions
does, with examples.

<ROUTINE_SECTION>(\\NONEWPAGE)
<ROUTINE>(ADDPREFIX\Prefix List Elements\\func_addprefix)
<SYNTAX>
$(ADDPREFIX prefix,text[ ...])
<ENDSYNTAX>

<ROUTINE>(CALL\Call User-defined Function\\func_call)
<SYNTAX>
$(CALL macro[,param[,...]])
<ENDSYNTAX>
<DESCRIPTION>
<P>
The CALL function makes it possible for a user to develop their own macro
functions.  To call a macro function, specify the name in <argument>(macro),
not the substitution, and pass up to 31 arguments in <argument>(param).
<P>
Before <argument>(macro) is call (looked up and resolved) the arguments
passed in <argument>(param) are resolved and defined as symbols $(1)-$(31),
with $(0) being <argument>(macro).
<P>
It is important to remember certain escaping rules when defining
callable macros.  MMK supports the concept of deferred substitution (see
<reference>(deferring) by using <S>(${) and <S>(}) as the substitution
delimiters.  It is necessary to use this method of substitution when
specifying the macro arguments outside of any builtin function call, for
example:
<CODE_EXAMPLE>
REVERSE = ${2} ${1}
FOO = $(CALL REVERSE,A,B)
<ENDCODE_EXAMPLE>
<ENDDESCRIPTION>

<chapter>(Using DEC/CMS with MMK\cms_chapter)
<p>
This chapter describes the use of Digital's DEC/Code Management System
(DEC/CMS) with MMK.

<head1>(The /CMS Qualifier\MMK_DOC_14)
<p>
The MMK command supports a /CMS qualifier, which activates the automatic
use of the currently set DEC/CMS library, or another DEC/CMS library that
you specify, for the current build.  This causes source files to be fetched
out of the DEC/CMS library automatically, if needed.  In addition, the MMK
description file will automatically be fetched out of the DEC/CMS library
if it does not exist.
<p>
The built-in suffix list and dependency rules in MMK include default rules
for fetching source files out of DEC/CMS libraries.  Suffixes ending in
a tilde character (<quote>(~)) signify DEC/CMS library elements.  The
built-in DEC/CMS element rules are used only if /CMS is specified on the
MMK command.

<head1>(Explicit CMS Element References\MMK_DOC_15)
<p>
You can explicitly reference a CMS library element in your MMK description
file by adding a tilde to the end of the file specification.  For
example:
<interactive>
MAIN.FOR  :  MAIN.FOR~
<endinteractive>
<p>
You can also explicitly name the CMS library from which the element should
be fetched, by specifying a device and/or directory name:
<interactive>
MAIN.FOR  :  SOURCE_DISK:[CMS_SOURCE]MAIN.FOR~
<endinteractive>
<p>If you do not explicitly name the CMS library, the currently set
CMS library (set with CMS SET LIBRARY) will be used.

<head2>(Specifying the Element Generation\MMK_DOC_16)
<p>
By default, MMK uses the qualifier /GENERATION=1+ on all CMS FETCH operations,
to get the highest-numbered generation of a particular element, or whichever
generation you specify on the MMK /GENERATION qualifier.
If you need
to build a dependency on a specific generation of an element, you may do
so by specifying the /GENERATION qualifier on the file name:
<interactive>
MAIN.FOR  :  MAIN.FOR~/GENERATION=37
<endinteractive>
<p>
The above example would cause generation 37 of the MAIN.FOR file in the
current CMS library to be used for the build.

<head1>(Inference Rules for CMS Files\MMK_DOC_17)
<P>
MMK comes with built-in inference rules for fetching source files from
a CMS library.  Like DEC/MMS, MMK uses these rules <emphasis>(only) when you
specify the /CMS qualifier on the MMK command.  This allows you to
have a makefile like the following:
<interactive>
TEST.EXE : TEST.OBJ
    $(LINK)$(LINKFLAGS) $(MMS$SOURCE)

TEST.OBJ : TEST.FOR
<endinteractive>
<P>
If you have a CMS library set and you specify the /CMS qualifier on the
MMK command, MMK will automatically check to see if TEST.FOR resides
in the CMS library and will fetch it out of the library if needed.
<P>
However, MMK also allows you to omit the second dependency in the makefile,
and will automatically <quote>(double-infer) the existence the .FOR file,
even if it has not yet been fetched out of the CMS library.
<head2>(CMS and Prefixed Inference Rules\MMK_DOC_18)
<p>
You can have MMK automatically search specific CMS libraries for source
files by using prefixed inference rules.  For example, if you were working
on a cross-platform development project which used two CMS libraries -
one for OS-specific source code and another for common source code - you
might use the following prefixed rules:
<interactive>
{CMSSRC:[VMS_SPECIFIC]}.FOR~{}.FOR :
{CMSSRC:[COMMON]}.FOR~{}.FOR :
<endinteractive>
<p>
This sequence would cause MMK to automatically search the CMSSRC:[VMS_SPECIFIC]
CMS library for a FORTRAN source file, then search the CMSSRC:[COMMON] library.
If the file were not located in either library, MMK would fall back to using
the currently set CMS library.  You must still have a CMS library set and
you must specify the /CMS qualifier for prefixed CMS inference rules to
be tried.

<paramdeflist>
<paramitem>(target-name)
<paramdef>
Name of the target to be built.  The target name must be listed in the
description file.  If no target name is specified, MMK builds the first
target it finds in the description file.  Multiple targets may be
specified as a comma-separated list.
<endparamdeflist>

<description>
The MMK utility builds a software system from the
objects and dependencies listed in a description file.  See the documentation
for additional information.
<enddescription>

<qualdeflist>
<qualitem>(/[NO]ACTION)
<qualdef>
Determines whether action lines are executed or just displayed.  Specifying
/NOACTION causes MMK to display the action lines that would be executed
to build the target, without actually executing them.

<qualitem>(/[NO]CHECK_STATUS)
<qualdef>
Directs MMK to determine whether a target is up-to-date, without executing
any action lines to do so.  MMK sets the global symbol MMS$STATUS to 0 if
the target requires updating, or 1 if the target is up-to-date.  This qualifier
overrides the /ACTION qualifier.

<qualitem>(/[NO]CMS)
<qualdef>
Determines whether a DEC/Code Management System (CMS) library is automatically
searched for the MMK description file and for any source files.
The default is /NOCMS, which omits any CMS checks.

<qualitem>(/CMS_LIBRARY=(dir-spec...))
<qualdef>
Specifies one or more DEC/Code Management System (CMS) libraries to be searched for the
MMK description file and for any source files that do not have explicit
CMS library specifications.  Effective only when /CMS is also specified.
If omitted, the default CMS library or libraries (from the logical name CMS$LIB or
the CMS SET LIBRARY command) are used.

<qualitem>(/DESCRIPTION=file-spec)
<qualdef>
Specifies an alternative name for the MMK description file.  The default
description file name is DESCRIP.MMS (in the current default directory),
with MAKEFILE. being used if DESCRIP.MMS does not exist.

<qualitem>(/DUMP)
<qualdef>
Causes MMK to dump the suffix list, all currently defined macros, all
inference rules, and all dependencies to the current output before starting
the build.  This qualifier is useful in debugging problems in rules files
and makefiles.

<qualitem>(/EXTENDED_SYNTAX)
<qualdef>
...describe what this does, largely for MMS compatability...

<qualitem>(/[NO]FORCE)
<qualdef>
Specifying /FORCE causes MMK to execute only the action lines from the
dependency rule for the target, without performing any revision
date checks and without building any intermediate targets.

<qualitem>(/[NO]FROM_SOURCES)
<qualdef>
Specifying /FROM_SOURCES causes MMK to perform a complete build of the
target, ignoring revision dates.  All actions to build all intermediate
targets are executed.

<qualitem>(/GENERATION=string)
<qualdef>
Specifies the default generation to be used when MMK fetches elements
out of a CMS library.  If omitted, the default generation is <quote>(1+), which
fetches the highest-numbered generation of an element.
You can use this qualifier in combination with CMS classes
to have MMK build a specific version of your software system, provided
that all source code for the system is fetched from CMS during the build.

<qualitem>(/IDENTIFICATION)
<qualdef>
Specifying /IDENTIFICATION causes MMK to display its revision information
and a copyright message, without performing any other action.

<qualitem>(/[NO]IGNORE[=level])
<qualdef>
By default, MMK stops when an executed action line results in a warning,
error, or fatal error status.  You can override this by specifying /IGNORE.
Using /IGNORE or /IGNORE=FATAL causes all errors to be ignored; specifying
/IGNORE=ERROR causes errors and warnings to be ignored; specifying 
/IGNORE=WARNING causes only warnings to be ignored.

<qualitem>(/[NO]LOCAL_RULES)
<qualdef>
Controls whether  site-specific inference rule definitions are
read in.  By default, they are if the logical name MMK_LOCAL_RULES is
defined and points to a readable description file.  Specifying /NOLOCAL_RULES
prevents this from occurring.

<qualitem>(/[NO]LOG)
<qualdef>
Controls whether MMK logs a detailed description of its activity.  By default,
it does not.

<qualitem>(/MACRO=file-spec <VBAR> definintion...)
<qualdef>
 Defines one or more macros that can be referenced by the description file.
If a name is specified with no equals sign (<quote>(=)), it is first assumed to
be a file specification; if the file exists, macro definitions are read
from the file.  A file type of .MMS is assumed if no file type is specified.
If the file cannot be found, the name is treated as macro definition, and
a value of <emphasis>(1\bold) is assigned to the macro by default.
<P> If an equals sign is present, the macro definition is taken directly from
the command line.
<P> Macro definitions contained in a file should have the same syntax as macro
definitions in description files, with the added restrictions that comments
and line continuations are not allowed.

<qualitem>(/OUTPUT=file-spec)
<qualdef>
Directs MMK output to a location other than the default, SYS$OUTPUT.

<qualitem>(/[NO]OVERRIDE)
<qualdef>
 Determines the order in which macro references are resolved.  The default
order is to resolve macros from command-line definitions, followed by
definitions in the description file and any rules files, followed by MMK
built-ins.  If a macro cannot be resolved from any of these sources, a check
is made for a DCL symbol with the same name as the macro, and if present, the
symbol's value is used.
<P> When /OVERRIDE is specified, DCL symbols are checked before the macro
definitions in the description and rules files, and before the MMK built-in
macros.

<qualitem>(/[NO]RULES_FILE[=file-spec...])
<qualdef>
Specifies the name of one or more description files containing inference
rules.  If /RULES_FILE is specified with no file specification,
the name MMS$RULES is used by default (this can be a logical name or can
reference a file called MMS$RULES.MMS in the current directory).
<p>
If /NORULES_FILE is specified, the compiled-in default rules are not
loaded when MMK is started, nor is any personal rules file (pointed to
by the logical name MMK_PERSONAL_RULES).  /NORULES_FILE does not prevent
the loading of local rules; you must also specify /NOLOCAL_RULES to
prevent local rules from being loaded.

<qualitem>(/[NO]SKIP_INTERMEDIATES)
<qualdef>
 By default, MMK attempts to build missing source files if they
can be built through the application of dependency or inference rules.
Specifying /SKIP_INTERMEDIATES causes MMK to treat these missing sources
as if they exist and have the same revision date/time stamp as the target
that depends on them.
<P> For example, if the target is a .EXE file which depends on a .OBJ file,
and that .OBJ file in turn depends on a .C file, by default MMK will build
the .OBJ file if it is missing, and then in turn build the .EXE.  If
/SKIP_INTERMEDIATES is specified, the missing .OBJ file will not trigger
a build; the build will only occur if the .C file is newer than the .EXE
file.

<qualitem>(/[NO]VERIFY[=ALL])
<qualdef>
Controls whether MMK echoes action lines to SYS$OUTPUT.  Enabled by default.
By specifying the keyword <argument>(ALL) it is possible to force MMK to
echo all command output, including that which is prefixed with
<emphasis>(@\bold).

For debugging purposes it is possible to specify the keyword ALL which will
cause MMK to verify all action lines, even those prefixed with @ (silent)
action line prefix.  This also overrides the .SILENT directive.

<qualitem>(/WORKING_DIRECTORY=dir-spec)
<qualdef>
Causes MMK to SET DEFAULT to the specified directory before processing
the description file.  This can be useful when using the /NOACTION
qualifier for a build in a directory containing subdirectories with their
own description files, since only actions invoking $(MMS) get executed when
/NOACTION is used.  By replacing the actions:
<INTERACTIVE>
  SET DEFAULT [.subdirectory]
  $(MMS) $(MMSQUALIFIERS)
<ENDINTERACTIVE>
<CP>with the action
<INTERACTIVE>
  $(MMS) $(MMSQUALIFIERS)/WORKING_DIRECTORY=[.subdirectory]
<ENDINTERACTIVE>
<CP>the entire multi-directory build can be tested with /NOACTION successfully.
<endqualdeflist>

<appendix>(Differences between MMK and DEC/MMS\MMK_DOC_19)
<p>MMK is patterned after DEC/MMS, but does not fully implement all DEC/MMS
functionality and provides other extended functionality.  This appendix lists
some of the differences between MMK and DEC/MMS.
<p>Besides the differences in features, there are some differences
in processing between MMK and DEC/MMS which may lead to different results
or syntax errors in MMK for description files which operate properly under
DEC/MMS.  If possible, please report any such differences to the author
so that they can be fixed.
<head1>(DEC/MMS Features Not Supported in MMK\MMK_DOC_20)
<p>MMK does not support the following DEC/MMS features:
<list>(unnumbered)
<le>MMK does not support FMS forms libraries or CDD/Repository libraries.
<le>MMK does not honor the <quote>(; <emphasis>(action)) syntax on
dependency rule lines that can be used with DEC/MMS.  Make sure all actions
are on separate lines.
<le>MMK requires the leading dot on the .INCLUDE directive.
<le>MMK does not handle wildcard dependency rules.
<le>MMK does not support all of the command qualifiers supported by
DEC/MMS.  In addition, the MMK's /GENERATION qualifier is completely different
from DEC/MMS's /GENERATE qualifier.
<le>MMK does not have a DECwindows interface.
<le>MMK does not automatically load the MMS$RULES file if that logical
name is defined or that file exists in the current directory; you must
specify /RULES on the MMK command to have it loaded.  Use the MMK_LOCAL_RULES
or MMK_PERSONAL_RULES logical names to have rules automatically loaded by MMK.
<endlist>

<head1>(MMK Extended Features\MMK_DOC_21)
<p>MMK includes the following features not found in DEC/MMS:
<list>(unnumbered)
<le>MMK gives you more options for rules files, and is set up to allow
multiple rules files to be present.  Rule file processing follows this
sequence:
  <list>(numbered)
  <le>The default rules compiled into MMK are loaded automatically unless
      /NORULES_FILE is specified on the MMK command.
  <le>A site-defined local rules file is loaded automatically if the
      logical name MMK_LOCAL_RULES is defined (use /NOLOCAL_RULES to
      override).
  <le>If the /RULES_FILE qualifier is specified, any rules files listed
      there are loaded; if none are listed, the default is to load
      the file MMS$RULES.MMS (or the file pointed to by the logical name
      MMS$RULES).
      <p>
      If the /RULES_FILE qualifier is omitted, a personal rules file is
      loaded if the logical name MMK_PERSONAL_RULES is defined.   MMS$RULES
      is <emphasis>(not) loaded in this case.
      <p>
      If /NORULES_FILE is specified, neither MMS$RULES nor the personal
      rules file is loaded.
  <endlist>
<p>These rules-processing features, coupled with the ability to redefine
macros defined in rules files, make it easier to customize MMK's behavior
when needed.

<le>MMK trims blanks out of $(MMS$SOURCE_LIST).
<le>MMK includes support for the following special local macros:
    <list>(unnumbered)
    <le>$(MMS$SOURCE_LIST_SPACES) - source list with spaces as separators
    	instead of commas.
    <le>$(MMS$CHANGED_LIST_SPACES) - list of changed sources with spaces
        as separators instead of commas.
    <le>$(MMS$SOURCE_NAME) - like $(MMS$TARGET_NAME), but for $(MMS$SOURCE).
    <le>$(MMS$TARGET_FNAME) - like $(MMS$TARGET_NAME), but does not include
        the device/directory specification, just the filename.
    <le>$(MMS$TARGET_MODULE) - name of the module being replaced in
        a text, help, macro, or object library.
    <ENDLIST>
<le>MMK will display activity in the subprocess while action lines are
being executed when you press CTRL/T.
<le>MMK allows you to redefine macros.
<le>MMK, in most cases, has more flexible syntax rules for its description
files, allowing blanks where MMS does not (e.g., in library module
specifications).
<le>MMK pre-defines the macros __VAX__ for builds on VAX systems,
__AXP__ for builds on Alpha systems, and __I64__ for builds on IA64 systems.
<le>MMK supports prefixed inference rules (described in <reference>(infrules)).
<le>When used with DEC/CMS, MMK will <quote>(double-infer) a dependency
      on a non-existent source file, if that file currently resides in
      a CMS library.
<le>MMK includes a /DUMP qualifier for debugging problems with makefiles.
<le>MMK provides a /GENERATION qualifier on the MMK command for specifying
the default CMS generation to be used when elements are checked for 
revisions and fetched out of CMS.
<le>MMK provides the /WORKING_DIRECTORY qualifier.
<le>MMK allows "generic" targets (those that do not refer to an actual
file) to have null action lists.  MMS requires all targets to have an
action list.
<le>MMK adds the ${name} syntax for deferring resolution of macros
on the right-hand side of a macro definition.
<le>MMK adds a generic string-susbstitution function for macro
references.
<endlist>
<p>You should avoid using these extended features if you need to
maintain compatibility with DEC/MMS.

<head1>(Other Differences\diff_other)
<p>
Besides the feature differences alrady mentioned,
MMK operates somewhat differently from DEC/MMS in some of its processing.
In most cases, these differences are not significant, but they are worth
remembering if you need to port DEC/MMS description files to or from
MMK.
<list>(unnumbered)
<le>MMK allows any rule, including built-in rules, to override the
.DEFAULT actions.  DEC/MMS lets .DEFAULT actions override built-in rules.
<le>When a build action does not update a target, MMK will issue an
information message, except for generic targets.  DEC/MMS only issues
such messages in certain cases.
<le>MMK explicitly builds dependency rules for files on which library
modules depend, even if those files are not mentioned in the description
file.  This may lead to MMK behaving differently from DEC/MMS, although
if the description file is correct, the end result will be the same.
<le>MMK parses comments and continuation lines differently, so that a hyphen
at the end of a comment is not considered a continuation of the comment.
<le>MMK is more lenient about applying inference rules.  It only checks for
a match on the suffix and, if present, the prefix.  If you have a dependency
with an explicit target and source that match by suffix (and possibly prefix),
even if the base names do not match, the inference rule can be applied.
MMS requires that base names match to apply an inference rule.  Note that
MMK's behavior may change to match MMS in a future release.
<endlist>
<p>As other differences are brought to the author's attention, they will
either be fixed or noted here.
