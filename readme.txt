The MMK Make Utility

MMK is a "make" utility for VMS systems.  It is used for building software
systems based on a "description file" (or "makefile") you create that lists
the sources and objects of a system and the dependencies between them.

MMK is similar in functionality to Digital's DEC/Module Management System (MMS),
and understands a syntax in its description files which is a superset of
that which is understood by MMS.  It also includes other features, such as:

   * Support for creating inference rules that separate source and target
     directories, the syntax for which was borrowed from NMAKE.  

   * Conditional execution support based on MMS, MMK's own syntax and
     GNU make.

   * Extensive builtin functions, as well as the ability to call user-written
     macros.

   * The ability to assign the output of a command (or command procedure)
     to a symbol.

MMK runs on VAX/VMS, OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS AXP, and OpenVMS IA64 systems.
It should build and run on versions of VMS older than V7.0, but is only
being maintained for more recent versions of the operating system.  MMK
has support for the DEC/CMS code management system, but does not require
it.

MMK is written entirely in C (with a little Macro).  Complete source code is
provided via github.  To download the latest kit, point your browser at:
